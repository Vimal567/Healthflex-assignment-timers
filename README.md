   - Expand/collapse categories to view individual timers.
   
3. **Timer Management**
   - Start, pause, and reset timers.
   - Mark timers as completed once the countdown reaches zero.

5. **Bulk Actions**
   - Bulk actions to start, pause, or reset all timers within a category.

6. **User Feedback**
   - Show snackbar with a congratulatory message when a timer completes.

### Enhanced Features:

   - A log of completed timers including the timer's name and completion time.

2. **Customizable Alerts**

## Technical Details

- **State Management**: `useState` and `useReducer` are used for managing the state of timers and categories.
- **Navigation**: React Router dom is used for navigation between the Home and History screens.
- **Persistence**: Timers and history logs are persisted using `Local Storage`.
- **Styling**: `StyleSheet` is used to create a responsive and clean layout.
- **Timers**: Timers are managed with `setInterval` for countdowns.

## Usage

1. **Home Screen**: Add, view, and manage timers. Timers are grouped by category, and each can be started, paused, or reset.
2. **History Screen**: View completed timers with their name and completion time.
3. **Bulk Actions**: Start, pause, or reset all timers in a category with a single action.

## Assumptions

- **Data Persistence**: Timers are stored locally using localStorage, and timers will persist even after closing the app.
- **Timer Duration**: The user sets the timer in seconds, and the app handles countdown functionality.
- **Completion Alert**: When a timer reaches zero, an on-screen modal will show a congratulatory message.
